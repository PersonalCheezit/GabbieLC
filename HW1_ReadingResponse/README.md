### Two things that I learned
- One thing I learned that I thought was cool was how there isn't an exact definition or language to describe live coding. It's very open ended and most that it has is a very very broad description!
- Another thing that I found interested that I learned is how how political live coding can get when it comes to how it ties into the balance between human and machine in a socialeconomical standpoint.

### Two things that I already knew
- One thing that I already knew was how it has a DIY/Punk ethos to it. It kinda reminds me of a musical version of the Dadaism sound wise and coding wise.
- Another thing that I kind of already knew was that it was very open ended in terms of what live coding could be! I just didn't realize how open ended it really was.
